Cointribute
=======

Originally developed in 24 hours for Coin-orado Hackathon 11/14-11/15 in Boulder, Colorado.

This web and ios application creates a platform for organizations/charities to accept donations through bitcoin from anonymous users.
It is built for personal or global causes that need a way to generate donations and creates transparency by displaying how all the money donated is used.
